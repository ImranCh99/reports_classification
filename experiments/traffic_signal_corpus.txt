Light cycle needs updated - this is a popular bike route and I use it almost every day. Unless a car is traveling N/S, the green light does not trigger. I have to get off my bike and press the pedestrian bed button. The SE crossing button does not trigger a walk sign. When the green light finally goes off, it only lasts about 3 seconds. I can just make it through on my e-bike. I can?t imagine someone in a wheelchair or slower device can make it through before oncoming traffic gets a green light

The timing for this stoplight is weird-- instead of changing when there are actually people waiting to exit the apartment building, it appears to just be on a set timer, and so there will be 50 cars waiting on Wells Branch, but nobody leaves the apartment complex. I think it would be beneficial to do another analysis of the traffic patterns at that stoplight, or set it to only turn if someone is actually trying to turn left onto Wells Branch from the complex, or anything to just have it better balanced between the different directions of traffic.

Lights out @ Southwest Parkway and Foster Ranch Road
Traffic signal broken
FYA Flash Rate Fault
The northbound light is stuck on red. I can see the pedestrian count-down go down to zero for east-west bound pedestrian crossing, then the east-bound traffic light will turn red to allow west-bound traffic to turn south onto Colorado. But then the west-bound light turns green again without the north-bound light turning green. Around 5pm, when the Capital staff from the underground parking (Colorado and W 14th) come out, that road gets very backed up with the light not turning green. Consequently, cars are having to get out of line to turn around and find a different route out of that road.

the walking signal  when you are crossing  burnet on Kramer heading to shopping center.
FIRST. Recent changes to intersection lights disconnected pedestrian lights.  Before they counted down and illuminated walk/dontwalk lights.  No longer.  Now they are showing halt sign all the time.  This is an intersection with significant pedestrian traffic and lights should be active.  SECOND.  a new traffic light has been hung over the left turn dedicated lane on the south side of the intersection (left turn from northbound  Lakeline into Ridgeline).  It is often green when the light on the north side of the intersection is flashing yellow.  This is confusing to those who see one traffic light (GOGreen) on one side while they see flashing yellow on other side of the intersection (left turn with caution).  These issues should be addressed for safety and convenience.

Good morning! Every morning around 6:00-630 a.m. and every night around 7 p.m. I travel down McAllen Pass with many other cars and we are all stopped by consecutive stop lights on this road, which appear to be there to let people out of the GM innovation plaza, however I rarely see anybody actually leaving the plaza. I think if you are able to change the time of these lights to lengthen the green on McAllen and shorten the green coming out of these side parking lots, you'd save a lot of commuters time and gas from the stopping and going. I almost always hit two red lights on this road on my way to Parmer. Thank you and have a great day!

reported via mobile: "When traveling northbound on far South Lamar, approaching the westbound lane of the access road that eventually becomes westbound 360 (exact coordinates from Google Maps: 3014'03.4"N 9747'44.2"W), the traffic signal is angled downward so much that it's impossible to determine if the light is red or green until the very moment that you enter the intersection. (This problem probably doesn't exist at night, when one would be able to detect the color of the signal.) It's been this way for weeks, and needs someone to inspect it and have the angle corrected."

Called in to report that green bulb is out
The traffic light at Lyndhurst/Staked Plains and Lakeline Boulevard is either malfunctioning or has been incorrectly retimed recently. The green phase for northbound Lyndhurst across Lakeline is either completely skipped or lasts just a few seconds, causing long backups toward the roundabout at Lakeline Mall Drive and forcing many drivers to uturn while stuck on Lyndhurst or intentionally run a red light across Lakeline Boulevard.

Previous technician notes:
"PED 2 on SWC has bad cable and will need to run new cable , cables runs overhead"
Previous technician notes: 
"Reason for pushbuttons not giving calls is because the cable for inputs on the pushbutton brain was not plugged in. Once I plugged it in I called MMC and confirmed pushbuttons were giving calls.

I also walked and pushed every push button but one button was not working.

I checked to see if the cable in the cabinet had power and had 24vdc.

I then checked the pushbutton to see if it had power to and it didn't have no voltage. Re stripped wires and still had no voltage.

I then twisted one end of the wires and checked the other end at the cabinet to see if the cable was good and I didn't get a reading. Cable is bad.

Called supervisor to see if he would want me to run cable but he said we can't grab no cable because inventory is doing inventory count."

Cycled power to SB push button brain, and metered out push button again; metered out at 0VDC. Twisted wires together at push button to test for continuity. Went to cabinet and checked both wire ends, came up with infinite resistance on multimeter (OL). Checked previous work orders for same issue, called Lawrence and Larry to ask about previous work order for same issue. Was told on NWC, there is a splice for the push button on the NEC. Exposed copper on both sides of splice to test for continuity from push button to splice. Multimeter read resistance, indicating no breaks in cable from button to splice. Metered out from button to cabinet again, came up infinite resistance. Notified supervisor Rudy Valentino with findings."

The pedestrian buttons at 17th and Guadalupe are not working. I tried three out of the four. It keeps skipping a pedestrian crossing because none of the buttons are working, creating a dangerous situation for pedestrians trying to cross on their own.
Loose pedestrian recall button
per caller mention pedestrian signals are turned around
The pedestrian walk signal button to cross south at the NE corner of 38 1/2 and Red River Street is not working.

It appears that the other speed limit radar signs previously installed by the city throughout the neighborhood have been removed. Furthermore, this particular sign looks to have been vandalized, as the solar panel atop has been smashed or shattered. Not only is this an obvious eyesore, but I am concerned that the broken glass on the solar panel could pose a potential hazard for individuals, pets, and vehicles if it were to fall.
Splice case and 100+ of Fiber detached from span wire and laying on sidewalk near PHB signal cabinet, needs to be resecured.

Daycall originally had this issue. Need them to get with Larry and find a good working stock legacy brain.
APS dead for NS, NEC, ESR, polara, (right arrow for button)

Buttons at intersection are not operating. Majority of buttons are missing cover to protect cables. (WRK24-261065).

Follow-up APS buttons on both NBSR and SBSR need attention (pic of 1 APS button attached) (WRK23-192445).

Found incorrect load switch output wiring all except 6PED. Needs to correct APS wiring
(WRK22-152610).
Phase 4 and 8 peds not servicing. Found both DC isolators are blown in cabinet, replaced both isolators. Phase 4 buttons are operable and servicing but not phase 8 (WB) buttons. Pulled westbound button on NWC off pole and inspected wire and buttons, no issues found. Tested push button wire at standard and tested bad. Open pullbox inspected wire and found splice, cut out and redid splice, tested wire back to the cabinet while splice was open and wire tested bad, same issue persisted. SWC WB  button is not operational either. Phase 8 WB peds put on maintenance recall in controller

Good morning City of Austin,I just want to make a recommendation for the traffic light when turning left out of Aborsode Dr to Dessau Rd. I've noticed that the light takes a really long time to turn green and when it does its lasts very little (about 3-4 cars make it, 5-6 if they pass it on red) so my suggestion is if we're able to either extend the time so that more cars can pass through or make both lanes be able to turn left (I've already seen a car use the right lane to turn left out of desperation). The community here is growing with new apartments being built and I would like to help the community by fixing this issue before it becomes bigger.Thank you and hope you have a good day.

The conduit on the northwest corner that connects the pull box to the standard has been repaired. SMS can run 20 conductor that's currently in pull box to standard, splice in new 20 and EARTC box is needed.
one direction has a solid green but everything else is flashing red in all directions.
Walk sign does not illuminate crossing Highland Mall Blvd northbound at intersection with Airport Blvd. The do not walk sign comes on, but the walk sign is blank, so drivers cannot see that pedestrians/bikes should have a walk sign.
Previous technician notes: 

"Need crew to run 2 7Conductors on span for the SEC ped and SWC ped going E/W."

Signal in flash.
Conflict on 4 & 13
Put a dummy load and figured out which ped is causing issue and we figured out that it was going to be on the NB side going EW which in the cabinet is 2 ped.

We opened up splices and there is 5 different splices where issue could potentially be. After further inspection we decided that we were going to homerun 5 conductors to the cabinet but when we tried to rod from first pull box to across the street we came across conduit issues.

I then called my supervisors to see what they would want to do for the mean time until they could get a crew out there to run span and wire to those 2 peds.

Left the dummy load in the cabinet.

In the cabinet it looked like they have already HR two 7 conductors for the SB side peds going E/W."


WRK24-261405
"2 ped on the SB side was dark. Red fail board was not seeing 120 v. Was able to give the rail fail board 120v. Was still not getting voltage on 2 ped.

I called Brian Goldburg to see if it was possible to move the ped over to 6 ped. I moved ped over to 6 ped and was not giving the Don’t Walk but was giving the Walk.

So then Brian gave me permission to cut diode card . So I cut diode 6-16 and Brian programmed ped for 8 ped. Walk and don’t walk comes up.

This location needs a cabinet swap as soon as possible.

...Upon arrival 2 ped was dark , tried changing out load switch and did not solve the issue I then tried changing out dummy load that was left by other technicians from a trouble call that was running 2 ped and did not solve issue , changed out monitor and red ribbon cable and did not work , bumped it out and was coming up , we were able to see that 2 ped was not getting voltage , so we changed it to 8 ped , and left new dummy load which are resistors "

Turn signal for the left turn from lakeline mall drive onto lake creek parkway is barely visible. The green arrow is very dim, to the point that drivers constantly miss it. Results in a large backlog of cars waiting to turn and people run yellows/reds to try and squeeze through as it takes a bit for people to realize it is even a green arrow.
School zone light is off or out for days. People are flying into the school zone at 45 mph.

The traffic signals on westbound 6th street have been out of sync for about a month now. Driving from congress to 6th you currently end up having one light turn green only to have the next light turn red as you approach it. With the exception of Lamar these lights should stay in sync with one another to keep traffic moving. Instead we have a situation where drivers are not able to efficiently navigate out of downtown, resulting in cars speeding to avoid missing the next light.

Received via email: 

Green traffic arrow at one traffic intersection is very faint and almost invisible in bright daylight. In particular, as you drive north-west along Southwest Parkway and approach W William Cannon Dr, the green turning light (shaped like an arrow pointing to the left), which indicates that you are allowed to turn left onto W William Cannon Dr, is the one that seems faint.

The other signals at the same intersection appear to be working properly.

Good evening. Just wanted to advise that the pedestrian button at the intersection of West North Loop Blvd. and Burnet Road heading west to Shoal Creek Blvd. (the crossing by William Holland Ave. next to Prosperity Bank and El Tacorrido) is hanging by its wires due to a possible accident. As visually impaired and elderly individuals live is this neighborhood, I wanted to report this issue due to major pedestrian traffic in the area. Thank you and I apologize for bothering your department. Thank you! As always, love my Austin!!!

The turn lane signal is so close to the middle lane that middle lane drivers are not paying attention when the green arrow appears it is for the left lane and not a regular green bulb for the traffic going straight however drivers still run the red light unknowingly. Caller has followed behind other vehicles multiple times and has almost gotten hit. When she is the first in line because she pays close attention she can see that the light is for the left turn traffic and not the bulb for the traffic going straight
the light is staying green on 2222 and on Jester it is stuck on red

Hello. I contacted you in May about this unresolved issue. School is about to start, and the traffic light at Slaughter and Barstow is confusing and dangerous. And it's very close to Gorzycki Middle School. While traveling eastward on Slaughter to turn left onto Barstow, I have several times experienced a green light with no left arrow and prepared to yield to oncoming traffic only to watch oncoming traffic (westbound) slow and stop at the light. When I look back, I see that they have a red light, but I still have a green with no arrow for a protected left turn. This happened to me again this evening, which reminded me that this obviously has not been addressed. My wife was with me this time, and she said she has experienced this same problem. On the day that I last reported this in May, I saw that the opposite lanes had the red light, I decided to go and had to quickly hit my brakes as the light turned green and the oncoming traffic proceeded to move. Either the timing of those lights needs to be synced or the left turn must be protected. I am not aware of any problems with from Barstow onto Slaughter. Please fix this dangerous problem.
AKINS HIGH SCHOOL. Signal heads reported loose and about to fall. Please take picture of the heads. IF the signal heads look dangerous, fix the signal and inform MMC and B. Bolander.

The school zone flashing light at the northern end of Dixie Dr. isn't working .
Traffic cycle too short, caused traffic
The light at Dessau and Parmer has too short of a cycle, especially going north on Dessau. The turn light is only active long enough for three cars (fewer if someone runs the prior light) and that is a fairly busy street. As a result it can take upwards of 7-10 minutes to get through the light. It needs adjusting to allow for more traffic from the two busiest directions especially - the other being east on Parmer, where traffic is backed up almost to Harris Ridge every morning.
APD states that the traffic signal is flashing

Citizen's email: "Hi Y'all - the recently installed lights at Waller and 7th, Lydia and 7th are not programmed to respond to the community and traffic conditions. Both Lydia and Waller are barely used roads in comparison to 7th, which is one of the most important and used east-west routes in East Austin. Despite this, both the Lydia and Waller lights have nearly equal green/red balance with 7th. It's very common for stacks of 10-15 cars to pile up in both directions on 7th while no one moves through the Lydia and Waller intersections. Plus, Lydia and Waller are only ~10 car lengths from one another, so even if one is green, the other might be red, stopping flow. I've started to see traffic backing up all the way to the I35 frontage."

Citizen's concern: "Traffic Signal Timing off: Left turn from Pearson Ranch Road to Avery Ranch WB timing off. Only turns green after 2-3 cycles. This is the 3rd time this year that this has broken. People tend to go through the red light because of this."
Hi, I am writing in regarding the signal on Guadalupe St when going southbound at the 51st intersection, particularly during the morning commute. I live two blocks away from the Guad and 51st intersection and use it frequently without any issue, however the lights don't seem to be as in synch in the mornings and often cause blocks worth of backup for southbound cars on Guad. This morning I sat at the intersection for at least 8 minutes without being given a green light. During this time northbound cars on Guad were given greens, and the East/West traffic on 51st was given (genuinely) five different cycles of green lights without a single one on the southbound Guad light. This resulted in many cars behind me pulling u-turns to be able to get out of the light, and even causing the car ahead of me and a bicyclist to run to red light. I was turning right and was able to get out of the situation, but who knows how much longer I would have been forced to wait. 

This has happened to me on several other occasions, and can cause traffic to back up on southbound Guad all the way past North Loop. This light is usually pretty effective, but it seems in the mornings something causes issue with the signal and a fix would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

941: Signal on Flash
Received via E-Mail: Yesterday there was a power outage in this neighborhood. Perhaps for that reason the traffic signal at the corner of Davis Lane and Beckett Road is malfunctioning. When a pedestrian pushes the button to cross that intersection heading north our south on Beckett Road-the problem occurs in both directions-the light on Davis Lane does turn red for the cars traveling on that road, but the light on Beckett also remains red. So all four lights are for perhaps ten seconds red. Then the light on Davis again turns green. Thirty seconds later approximately the light on Beckett finally turns green and allows pedestrians to cross. In other words there is a blip in the system. The pedestrian assumes that because the Davis Lane lights have turned red that the Beckett lights will also turn green. But that green does not appear until another cycle in favor of Davis Lane.

the parking lot traffic signals at Bowie High are timed so poorly, it takes up to 30 minutes to leave after drop off or pickup. The left signal heading west on Slaughter only lets 5 cars thru and there are entire minutes without any green light for anybody. It has worked properly in the past, but something must have changed when the time change happened 2 weeks ago?

Citizen's email: "At the NORTHEAST corner of the intersection of Victory Drive and West Ben White Boulevard, the two pedestrian crossing buttons on the metal pole are completely non-functioning (this is very close to the Victory Medical Center Pharmacy, addressed as 4303 Victory Drive).  I didn't happen to see a vertical, yellow strip with black digits on it--perhaps it was there and I just didn't see it.  Please repair both of the pedestrian crossing buttons on that metal pole."
the button is smashed in and can't be pushed, all the corners should be checked for damaged.

I put in a ticket two months ago and this issue was not satisfactorily resolved. The technician reported the light is working and closed the ticket. 
 I know the lights were working when I wrote the ticket.  The problem is this light is supposed to be on a sensor during nonpeak hours.  Two months ago the lights were taken down due to a storm.  The lights were quickly repaired but they did not put them back on a SENSOR.  They've been on a sensor during the overnight hours for years.  This is a "T" intersection.  Lakeline is the primary road at this intersection and it is crossed by Ridgeline on one side.  I submitted a similar ticket for another intersection along Lakeline and that light was fixed correctly.  What I am requesting is that you fix the Ridgeline light the same way you fixed the Pecan Park light. 

This light is supposed to be on a SENSOR during the overnight, nonpeak hours, giving Lakeline traffic right of way (DEFAULT TO GREEN for Lakeline traffic). This light is now on a schedule. At 3:00 AM there is hardly a car on Ridgeline. Lakeline commuters heading from and towards 183 are having to stop for NO ONE at this intersection at 3:00 am. Even the bike riders go right through this intersection and don't stop at this light.  Only the people riding in cars sit there, waiting for the light to go back to green.  I suppose the "ghost" driver that was once on Pecan Park is now making his left turn from Ridgeline. Please fix this signal correctly and put it back on sensor to agree with existing traffic patterns, giving LAKELINE traffic the right of way. You fixed the Pecan Park light but this one is still adding unnecessary time (sitting and waiting for NOT a single vehicle) to my daily commute to work, other commuters and the airport travelers. We all continue warming the earth...idling.

Technician notes: "Northbound left 5 sections louver is not aimed correctly due to restriping of road. The current setup of the signal head does not allow it to be adjusted left or right and the head will need to be removed and remounted using ONLY an Astro bracket in order to properly align the head."
The timing for this light early in the morning (and for most small, neighborhood side streets with lights along Slaughter Ln) should be sensored instead of timed before 6:00 am. It causes quite a bit of backup in traffic for cars driving along Slaughter Ln with very few or no cars at the side streets turning onto Slaughter Ln when their lights turn green.

Issue with pedestrian signal (to cross Guadalupe on the north side of intersection) and green arrow (for traffic going WB on 27th to NB on Guadalupe). Green arrow pointing to the right is given for WB-to-NB vehicle traffic even when the pedestrian signal is a white "walk" for the crosswalk the turning traffic crosses. A green arrow should not be given if a crosswalk that turn crosses over has a walk signal. (Should be green ball only.) Vehicles may assume from green arrow that there is no pedestrian conflict, however this is a busy pedestrian area with many using that crosswalk given proximity to UT and the Drag.

Caller stated that there is an issue with the turn signal at this location. They said the turn signal stays red, while the main road is green, which is causing traffic to become backed up. They mentioned that the pedestrian crossing walk sign was run into during the Winter storm and has been replaced however it hasn't been programed correctly which is affecting the way this intersection is becoming backed up at this time. This for going South on 183 to turn onto Montopolis dr. They said this is also causing a safety issue too. It automatically turns on the pedestrian crossing, when before it required someone to press the button first, which is creating the issue.

TEST
DSDD at 8037 Escarpment Boulevard
Austin, TX 78749
This light is supposed to be on a sensor during the overnight, nonpeak hours, giving Lakeline traffic right of way (default to green for Lakeline traffic).  Inexplicably this light is now on a schedule.  At 3:00 AM there is hardly a car on Pecan Park on one side of Lakeline Blvd.  On the other side of of Lakeline Blvd is an apartment parking lot.  Lakeline commuters heading from and towards 183 are now having to stop for NO ONE at this intersection at the ungodly hour of 3:00 am.  We sit there,  even having to wait for the turning signals to change for I presume the "ghost" vehicle making a left turn.  This signal is one of several all along Lakeline Blvd between 183 and past Cypress Creek that were all on sensors at one time for many, many years.  I say were because I put in a service ticket (#23-00244038) back in May to get the signal lights at Ridgeline and Lakeline Blvd corrected following a storm that took that light out.  That signal light has NOT been fixed.  That light is supposed to be on a sensor as well, but when it was repaired, it was put on a schedule.  Now Lakeline traffic is having to sit at TWO intersections for little to 0 traffic at 3:00AM.  Please fix  both of these signals and put them back on sensors to agree with existing traffic patterns,  giving LAKELINE traffic the right of way.  Believe it or not, it is adding unnecessary time (sitting and waiting for NOT a single vehicle) to my daily commute to work as well as for anyone else travelling between Leander and 183 that uses Lakeline to get to the airport.  Yes, many of the travelers at this hour on Lakeline are on their way to to the airport to catch their early bird flights out. Don't make us have to continue sitting there for no reason in idling vehicles, wasting time, wasting gas and contributing to global warming.  Just not smart.

Before 6:00am, the lights at this intersection remain red in all directions and turn green with approaching cars from any direction.  According to the report, the lights were monitored and nothing wrong.  However, the time frame marked would have been AFTER the lights switch to timed, so they would appear to be operating normally.  Travel on Mesa (north bound) does not activate lights.

The traffic light at RM 2222 and Jester has poor timing setup for it.  It often turns red for 2222 when NO cars are coming from Jester, and it is far too short being green.  It is most noticeable in the early morning hours (5am) when I go to work.I often get stopped for a long time for no cars coming in any other direction.

Request one of two adjustments:

1) install sensors to keep it green on 2222 unless a car is coming on Jester.

2) adjust the timing to be green for 2222, especially during "off peak" hours.

Citizen's email: "The "push to walk" button (or wiring to it) must be shorted for the following signal. It ALWAYS wastes the time for a walk period on one side even when no one has been there to push the button. This traffic signal is at the junction of Pond Springs Road and Hunter's Chase road in the Jollyville area (78729). The "walk" light is always activated to cross the Pond Springs part going to the south-east from that point (ie, between the Challeger school and the Valero station)."

Bus lane signal not going green
Hi,  the traffic light on W12th street heading south on North Lamar is not very visible especially when it is green, you have to be very close to it to see it, it appears black at a fairly close distance which is dangerous, I suspect the LED's orientation is pointing downwards or perhaps it is not receiving enough electricity. all the other traffic lights on North Lamar heading south after W12th street can be seen several blocks ahead, so it is only an issue with this particular one.

didn't find the exact entry in the list for the issue I wanted to report so I just picked a random one, maybe you can add "other" for other issues.

The signal timing has recently been changed resulting in unsafe and unwarranted left turn signals for east bound 41st.  The east bound lanes will get a turn signal despite no cars in the turn lane and the signal lasts for more than half of the duration of the light, resulting in west bound 41st drivers being stuck 12+ deep waiting to go and eventually missing the light.  This has resulted in people pulling through the shopping parking lot to take a left on red river to take a right on 41st, and also has resulted in people running the red light much more frequently.

The signal at this intersection unnecessarily offers a green signal to Rain Creek, even if no vehicles or pedestrians are present. This signal has been in this state for nearly 2 years, and we've opened several similar cases hoping for resolution, but our request keeps getting closed.

Cars are now occasionally running the red on Great Hills Trail when no Rain Creek traffic is present. This is dangerous, and could be curtailed when the signal is adjusted such that it only offers a green to Rain Creek when needed for arriving vehicles.

Please, please....if this needs to go to another city department, leave this request open until the final resolution is reached. It's been frustrating to have this occurring for nearly 24 months, opening several requests, and continue to see them marked as Resolved when the issue remains.

**Received via Austin 311 Email**

Citizen's email: "At the SOUTHWEST corner of Brodie Lane and West William Cannon Drive, near the Walgreens store, the pedestrian crossing signal for pedestrians desiring to cross Brodie Lane walking EASTBOUND does NOT function.  Despite vigorous pressing of the button device, NO "WALK" signal results from that vigorous pressing of that button--the "DONT WALK" signal simply remains unchanged.  Please repair that pedestrian crossing signal at the SOUTHWEST corner of that intersection.  I cannot provide the City with a "pole" number as the "pole" (upon which the "arm" containing vehicular traffic signals) does NOT have a vertical yellow strip on it containing black digits--and perhaps it is not supposed to."

Received via email: Driving in the neighborhood this weekend, we noticed that the timing of the traffic light at Duval and 51st Street has changed. The green light seems to only be on for a few seconds before it turns back to red. Allowing only a few cars through at a time. This not only causes a long back up of cars, but encourages drivers to run the red light to get through. It also doesn't allow enough time for pedestrians to cross safely. I don't know if this was a temporary change and is fixed by now but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Citizen's concern: "Cannot see the GREEN of traffic light
West bound Lakeline Mall Dr at 183.  Also similar issue at other nearby traffic lights. Cars first in-line stopped at red light cannot see green light when it lights.   There is a polarizer on the green light and causes it to appear black to the first driver in-line.  I was the 2nd car and had to honk for a long time to have the first car move forward.   If the driver cannot see green, then it's not clear if the red light just burnt out.   Many of the traffic light in this area have this useless and terrible "feature".   Please fix these traffic  lights and remove polarizers before it kills someone."

Notes from submitter: The timing of the light is terrible. Southwest Parkway. Traffic is having to stop even though there's nobody on Terra Vista. Furthermore the left turn lights are staying green even though there is nobody turning left. This makes the southwest parkway traffic white even more. Can you please fix this light? all of the lights on Southwest Parkway need to have their timing fixed. This is just maddening. Thank you.

Two weeks ago, the timing has change. The green arrow on Davis West bound turning left onto South bound Becket is green and stay green for a long time when there is no traffic turning left, but the light going through the intersection is red for a long-time traffic backs up. Happens at 6am for the last two weeks. East Bound lanes stays red heading towards Mopac, and the west bound traffic is green. Caller has called three times regarding this issue. Caller requesting a call back. When caller logs in to see the status of the signal. The department is closing out stating the system checks out ok and that is not the case the light is malfunctioning.

I want to request a traffic light repair for the intersection of Guadalupe St and Airport blvd. On Guadalupe street going southbound at the intersection, there's apparently a traffic sensor in the street that's not detecting a car is present to trigger a traffic light change. I've found that I have to pull way forward almost into the intersection late at night to get the light to change. And lately even that doesn't seem to be working. And often I come up behind another car that's just just been sitting at intersection with no light change, who's forced to eventually just run the light or turn and go a different direction. I've had to run the intersection sometimes late at night too. The sensor in the street needs to be improved, and particularly a new sensor needs to added further back to ensure cars can trigger the light without pulling so far up to the inside the intersection. It's not a right-angle intersection which makes it harder to deal with. I think the difficulty with the intersection at this point in the street is an underground pipe running right where the ideal senor position would be for southbound Guadalupe. And that requires additional sensor to be added on both sides of the underground pipe I think. Also when the senor is apparently triggered from the other direction by another car, the light is still taking a very long time to change. It almost feels like it's not going to change. It would be nice if you could reduce that trigger time too when it does detect a car present. But at least, this malfunctioning sensor needs to be looked at.

Slaughter/IH35 is having a overlap ped 4 constant call.
I had opened the request# 22-00308244 just 2 days back. It is marked resolved and closed but nothing is fixed yet. 

This particular curve has a sharp curve where cars would be coming at 40-50 miles speed. As tree branches are blocking flasher during school hours, cars may miss the 25 mph limit or may realize too late. Someone needs to trim couple of tree branches to make lights clearly visible.
Jonathan spotted 3 missing signal head visors in the field at Parmer/620.
Traffic light timing E Slaughter & I-35 heading west is too short. It is taking 5-10 changes of lights (up to 15 minutes) to head west on E Slaughter at the I-35 NB intersection. This started occurring after the speed limit dropped to 40MPH a few weeks ago. Can the timing be increased to let more cars through?

We will be transferring the existing arm and standard to the new foundation on the SEC corner. The arm and peds may need to be recabled due to the location of the new foundation. At the time that the arm is down we are to replace all LEDs in the heads and peds for this direction. APD will be needed to complete this work.
A wood pole has been set on the SWC of 21st and Guadalupe. We are going to transfer the cabinet and signals to the wood pole. The Arm and Standard are to be removed and heads will be hung on the overhead span. The source and intersection cable is already in an overhead span that will need to be transferred. A span and cable will have to be run from the wood pole to the NWC pole and spliced in hand hole so the cable can be removed from the underground conduit across 21st.

Please see below, about a school zone sign that was dangling, at 14850 Harris Ridge, for Ruth Barron ES.  I’ve asked them for clarification if their County techs reattached the sign, but we’d probably still need to go out and verify, since it’s our sign.  And while they’re out there, they could check and make sure the school zone flasher is still operating fine, if there was any damage to the pole that caused the sign to be dislodged in the first place.

citizen states the traffic signal at Deerbrook and 620 would benefit from either reprogramming the timing and/or adjusting/replacing the sensor. The issue only exists for traffic facing north on Deerbrook while parked at the light. The light will often times cycle through several times for oncoming traffic on 620 without ever providing a green light for traffic turning from Deerbrook on to 620. We've heard this problem voiced by many residents in the area.

Walk sign doesn't activate on green light unless a pedestrian hits the request to cross button before the light turns green. So pedestrians think they can't cross when it's really their turn because the walk sign fails to change with the traffic light. This picture is at Chicon and may still be the case at comal.

Good morning. The "Airport Blvd" street sign on the traffic light pole at the entrance to Austin Community College (across from Denson Drive) is hanging at an angle, and appears to be loose and a danger to anyone nearby. Thank you.

4015: Congress at Leland PHB- #62324 PHB not working right
Somehow the frequency of the Fairfield southbound light heading across 183 has changed to 5 seconds. During morning rush hour and when Navarro High School gets out after 4:00, 20 or more cars are backed up at this light. They're speeding through the Church's Chicken parking lot, making fast u-turns and speeding through the neighborhood, and jumping curbs under 183, all to get around this ridiculous new situation. I assume this signal frequency change couldn't have been on purpose because that would be unthoughtful.

information received from ATD Signs SR 21-00407386, "this is the crosswalk button at the northeast corner of Denson and Guadalupe (across Denson from Reilly ES) this is the crosswalk button - it is inoperable. When pressed it previously said "program this button". Now it doesn't register being pressed. The little kids have a crossing guard so it isn't really a safety hazard but old people who run on Guadalupe have to way to "inform" the crosswalk they intend to pass on foot. This is literally the least important request you'll receive today."

Citizen's concern: "Green lights crossing major intersections too infrequent and brief: I cross several major streets by bike with my children in a trailer. Green lights along the route have always been infrequent and don't automatically change unless a car is there or if a pedestrian pushes the button. Recently, changes have caused these lights to be extremely brief, making it hard to catch a light even when it does change. I understand these are thoroughfares, but even more importantly they are key crossing points for people in the neighborhood. I drive too, so understand this perspective, but most of the time cars would pass through these lights just to get slowed at the next major intersection anyway. I would be grateful if the city could consider making key crossings have longer green-light times, and/or change more frequently to respect people in their neighborhoods (not just the cars zooming past). Also, if the lights don't change automatically, it would be ideal if they could be activated by bikes too. Thank you!"

This is a dangerous intersection because it is at Lamar Middle School where kids walk to and from school and having a non-working walk signal puts children at risk.

The bike light sensor is unreliable. It is a camera ostensibly pointed at the green marked square. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Worst of all, there is no status indicator saying whether it has seen you. This means that cyclists have to use the ped button which means a longer light cycle for all. In addition there is no signage about how to use this system and it's unclear that anyone could know the camera was there in the first place.
Meet with LEVY get all aps button, radar, and nearside signals into the cabinet and terminate.

There is a unit on Pecan Creek in the vicinity of the intersection with Sandy Loam Trail that is confirmed deployed but not present in the cloud. We need the tech to check out that location and let us know about the issue with the unit.
At 7am, the light runs a full cycle from Village Center and the business parking lot, with protected turn arrows each way, one side at a time, then protected arrows from Far West. No one is using these long protected cycles at this hour, so for anyone on Far West, it's a several-minute wait for no reason. It's also timed badly so that if I turn onto Far West from SB Mopac with a green light (whether I make the light at Wood Hollow or have to stop there) I immediately get a red light at Village Center. This is a fairly new change, within the last few months; since it began cycling this way I don't think I have ever hit this light when it's green--every morning I have to stop for no reason. So this isn't really about the flash schedule (there wasn't an option for this problem) but to adjust the timing and length of the light's cycle.

There has been many morning that the left turn light on the intersection of Scofield Farms Dr and Parmer Ln. coming from I-35 stays red and takes a long time to change to green, it can stay red for 6 or more minutes. The traffic created is dangerous because the left turn line of cars blocks other lanes making it very unsafe and causing unnecessary traffic. I sat in the turn left lane this morning for 6 minutes until finally it turned green.
walking NB on the west side of the intersection the countdown starts at 93 and goes down instead of 13 and down
The left green arrow light is broken. When the signal changes, the driver can't see it so the entirety of its green light, we're sitting there, until it turns yellow and then people gun it to try and make the turn.

The walk-request signal has been malfunctioning for 2 days. If one pushes the button to cross from the east side of burnet to west, the walk signal doesn't activate (ever).  Must be either a dead button or a malfunctioning control.  Thanks for taking care of this, I cross there frequently, and the cars are more than happy to run me down regardless of the signal showing, but seeing that little dude "walking" just warms my heart.  I know when the big suburban runs me over, at least the city of Austin said I could cross before I turned into a splatter of tomato juice.  Happy new year!

Hi. I work at Samsung in Austin. In the last few weeks, the traffic light pulling off of Samsung Plant Road onto East Parmer Lane has been green about 1/4 as long as it used to be. Right now, about 3 cars per lane can pull out before it turns yellow. Sometimes we wait 4, 5 or even 6 times at the light before we get through. I don't know if the light is that way all the time but I have noticed it between 4pm to 5:15pm. Thank you for your assistance.

RIGHT turn GREEN arrow bulb is either burnt out or extremely dim. (This is obvious in comparison with the brightness of the yellow arrow.)

As a result, drivers don't realize they have a green arrow and treat it like a right on red, which defeats the purpose.

This is for people heading westbound on Wm Cannon and trying to go north on the Mopac service road.

Also, a timing question about the same signal. The sequence is currently (1) right green arrow, (2) right yellow arrow, (3) regular green. Could the yellow arrow be eliminated since it is followed by green? It slows people down and doesn't seem to serve any purpose.

the left hand turn signal from Morado Circle onto Jollyville Rd is only a yellow light turn, not a green light turn.  This means that a car turning left must wait for oncoming traffic from Braker Lane to clear.  The line of sight is almost always blocked by traffic on Braker turning left onto Jollyville.  This is a dangerous situation because one does not have a clear view of oncoming traffic.  This left hand turn signal used to be a fully protected green left turn signal where oncoming traffic from Braker was stopped. Why was it changed?  This is my second request for review, I know it was reviewed previously but I don't feel safe anymore turning left here.  If an accident happens it could be a bad one.  Thank you.

It used to say "wait to cross Spicewood and Mesa" and you would get about 25 seconds to cross the road on the walk signal. Now it says nothing (and it doesn't even feel like the button is going down). My biggest concern is that you now only have about 15 seconds to cross the road, which means I barely have enough time. Some crossers are older and slower than me and wouldn't be able to make it before the light changes."

This message is from Thomas Macaulay. [ thomas.p.macaulay@gmail.com ]
Several times now, I've gotten stuck at a light that doesn't "see" me or other drivers. I will be at an intersection for 5+ minutes. Today I saw 5 people run a red light and almost cause an accident due to waiting 8 minutes at a light. The intersection I see this most often is Wells Port + Wells Branch. This is frustrating, potentially dangerous and needs to be addressed.

The existing left turn phase from EB Pegram to NB Burnet is insufficient.  Left turn traffic is presented with a red arrow to protect (mostly nonexistent) bicycle traffic in the Justin/Pegram bike lane, and if WB traffic on Justin lane is still oncoming when the red arrow goes out, frequently only one vehicle is able to make the turn before the light goes red.  Left turn traffic needs more time allowed, by shortening the bike lane protection time or making it selective, installing a sensor in the left turn lane to extend the available time if required, or adding a protected left turn cycle, to avoid leaving multiple vehicles stranded for multiple light cycles.

Citizen's concern: "Walk signal @ the SW and SE corner of 6th & Lavaca  crossing Lavaca doesn't have the count down or stop hand light."
Northeast corner northbound push button not working, cable is bad. Installed new button on wire, new button would not actuate. Inspected wire on back of input file, noticed wires are different in cabinet then in field meaning wire is spliced. Tried ohming wire anyway and no continuity found on wire. Traced wire to pull and inspected wire inside signal pole and pull box, no issues found. Cut open push button wire splice and found no issues. Noticed wires in pull box not same wire landed in cabinet, implying another splice somewhere in the circuit. Wire will need to be traced out and other splice will need to be found and cut open.

**Received via Austin 311 Email**

Citizen's email: "The traffic signal at 4100 West Slaughter Ln has had extended pauses lately. There have been a number of instances where traffic in all directions has had red lights for close to three minutes and no walk indications. I'm not sure if it's related to the school and more noticeable now that it's a holiday week, but it's causing a number of driver to think the lights are broken and they roll through to make their own traffic schedule. Just thought I would send a note."

Citizen's email: "I wrote about a week ago, reporting that the light at the intersection of Davis Lane and Beckett Road was malfunctioning; I said that I could understand why frustrated motorists at that intersection would begin to ignore the red light and proceed, to the danger of both them and the alternate traffic. This morning on my walk I saw my concern twice. I approached that intersection twice between 6 and 7 this morning. The drivers on Beckett Road had apparently become so frustrated that both coming and going along that road I saw cars ignoring the red light. Ironically after they had crossed the intersection, the light turned green, but I suspect that the reason was simply that the cars' movement triggered the sensor; I doubt that the green means the drivers would have gained a green light if they had waited just a few more seconds.
The lights do not always malfunction, but when they do, drivers have no recourse. And someone is going to be hurt."

The pedestrian and bike signals on Shoal Creek Blvd at the intersection of Allandale Rd do not automatically turn green. This is a major problem for cyclists since there is no easy way to leave the bike lane and press the pedestrian button on the side walk. It basically forces cyclists to run a red light when drivers might think they could take a left turn. It's a hazard to drivers and cyclists alike on a very busy bike route. Please either make the bike light turn green automatically OR install a cyclist sensor that detects when bikes are present.

Received via E-Mail: At the intersection of Freidrich Ln & Woodward St. the traffic light will not change and allow the Capitol Metro Route# 7 (North Bound) bus to make a left turn on to Woodward St. Maybe the sensors in the asphalt pavement are incorrectly spaced or malfunctioning. On Saturday 03/26/2022 & Sunday 03/27/2022 at or about 6pm, the Cap Metro Route#7 (NB) bus was waiting for the light to change, but it never would. The driver as well as us passengers waited in bewilderment as the light would not change, and cars behind us were going around the bus to turn left on to Woodward St. I have experienced this before early in the morning (AM) hours as well. The driver has to turn left on Woodward St. on a red light and this is not safe for everyone on the bus. Is there anyway someone could investigate this intermittent problem please?

Hi, will you please check the settings on that light. At 5 am when I'm heading down Parmer that light is red for Parmer way too long. I understand that in rush hours lots of cars are coming off Legendary and Riata Vista. At the 5 am there are rarely any. Cars moving up and down Parmer are stopped unnecessarily and for way too long. 

Thanks for looking at this.

From east Wandering Way, attempting left onto S Dessau Rd., during daytime hours the signal often does not turn over to allow a left hand turn. Maybe it is height of vehicle. The crosswalk signals will change and countdown and the traffic from Dessau to Wandering Way in both directions is given turns but from E Wandering Way to S Dessau the lights themselves (not the crosswalks) will not change. The crosswalks after counting down to don't walk go back to walk and no turn signal is given. This happens most during weekeday day hours; you can sit waiting for a left hand turn for 15 minutes until a car coming from W Wandering Way trips the light sensor and gives a green light for both directions from Wandering onto Dessau.

The left turn from Gracy Farms to Stonehollow going to ACC Northridge has a left turn arrow. However it is never solid, it is only blinking. The result of this is that there is often a long line of cars waiting to turn left through several light changes.
Please make the left turn arrow solid green!

I also want to complain about the light at Gracy Farms and Schwab Way. Your web sited said it doesn't exist but I assure you it does. It has the number 1046. I assume that it was paid for by Schwab because it is completely unnecessary for all other traffic on Gracy Farms!!! But since it's there at east fix the timing. Not cars on Gracy Farms must stop basically all the time, even on weekends!!! It doesn't make any sense. If Schwab paid for it, let also pay for some kind of sensor, which leaves the on green for Gracy Farms, except when there is a car going to or coming out from Schwab Way. Until that is done, at least turn the light off on weekends when nobody is working at Schwab. Please...

This concerns the traffic light at Davis and 8800 Beckett.  There is NO vehicle detection. The light seems to be on a simple timer and stops the cars on Davis when there are no cars on Beckett.  The light should never change when there is no traffic on Beckett present.  Stopping and starting cars on Davis when there are no cars on Beckett is a terrible waste of gas.
Thank you for looking into this.

Caller stated the lights for the intersections remain green for the traffic on 45th st, and the lights only cycle through when they detect a car, but they don't detect the bikes, you then have to go and hit the pedestrian signal for the light to change. Caller suggest the lights just signal through in the mornings instead of only changing when it detects vehicles. Alternatively she would like the lights to just detect bikes.

*Image attached* Received via Mobile App: My son and I were riding east on the Denson bike and got to the airport intersection. We stopped just at then beginning of the green part of the ramp heading into the intersection. The bike signal stayed red through two cycles of the whole intersection. On the third cycle we just went with the green car light. After we made it across, I noticed that the green bike signal had finally turned on. It seems that some tweaking is necessary to make this bike signal work for people.
The crosswalk signals for both directions across the north and west side of the intersection of Escarpment Blvd. and William Cannon Dr. never turn white, even while waiting through multiple light cycles and repeatedly pressing the cross button.  I'm not able to get to, for instance, the Walgreens on the northwest corner of that intersection without going against the light.

Could someone please fix the pedestrian crossing signals on those two corners of that intersection?  Thanks!

(Recv'd via email) Hi there  This morning I waited for the pedestrian crossing signal at the very busy light for McNeil and Oak Knoll  and it never turned green. I experienced this while crossing the street in both directions. I pushed the button for it on both sides of the street and got no response. I waited for 10 minutes this morning for a car to finally approach on Oak Knoll and at least the traffic light responded to that. I ran across the street for the brief space that the light was green for that one car. I use this route daily on foot to get to work... so I really need this fixed. Please help   Thanks

When headed north on Beckett, I've sat for several minutes (I timed it) at the red light without it changing, when there was little to no traffic on Davis (and no one headed southbound on Beckett). This has happened when I've been in both the left turn to turn west onto Davis, and the straight lane to cross it, both at 7pm and 1am, among other times. The light for Beckett stays red, and as soon as car comes down southbound Beckett, the light on Davis immediately turns yellow the moment they roll up to the line. I'm also not sure why at 1am this light isn't set to be flashing red like the light at Davis Ln and Escarpment, and Convict Hill and Escarpment. Thanks!"

Pedestrian signal at intersection of W Braker Lane and Domain Drive/Exploration Way. The pedestrian signals no longer count down the seconds remaining. Nor do they start flashing to warn pedestrians not to cross.  Instead, the signals abruptly change from "walk" to "don't walk" with only a few seconds before the vehicle signals change.

Center E/B Sigals In Lanes
I was at the intersection at night (8pm or so) on convict hill, turning on to escarpment, towards william cannon. The light was repeatedly giving a green light to go straight but a red light to turn left! (not even yellow). So I was trapped! I don't like turning left out of my neighborhood (oliver loving) sometimes because people use it as a cut-through to get to hwy 290 and there have been accidents there so when I assume there are more drunk drivers/speeders, etc, I avoid it, in favor of the safety of the light. but the light effectively trapped me!! I feel like it's been doing that more (not giving green turn arrows, or ANY arrows) so I'm forced go out of my neighborhood. Which is fine at 6am, but not really ideal during rush hour or after happy hour.

Westbound W Parmer, left turn onto Metric Blvd. The sign keeps changing from indicating that the turn lane is a Left Turn Only lane (correct) to Straight Only (incorrect) and back again! I have never seen this happen before in my life. The sign seems to be made out of slats of metal instead of one solid piece. Could you fix this sign PERMANENTLY? People keep driving over the solid line to enter the turning bay because they are being confused by the incorrect sign as they approach the intersection. It's ridiculous that this sign keeps changing. It is broken and needs to be *REPLACED*, and not just repaired or doing some other temporary, half-measure. - This was reported to Signs but they advised to send this to Signals

I called this request in a few weeks ago, but the issue still persists. The traffic light at the corner of Country Trails Lane and Quinlan Park Road is not functioning correctly. Usually, after hours and early mornings the light is green when traveling N/S bound on Quinlan and then is triggered when a car approaches Country Trails Lane. However, for the past several weeks the light just cycles. At 5 in the morning you will just sit there waiting for the light to turn green and there is NO ONE around... Can someone please change it back? 
Thank you! 
As a side note I've noticed for the last three days the same is happening at Steiner Ranch Blvd and Quinlan Park Rd. Will you check it out, please?

Lately, possibly since a power outage, between 8 and 8:30 am (possibly more, that's just when I'm here), the through-light on McKinney Falls Parkway is green for only 12 seconds. This causes lengthy backup during rush hour. This morning I sat at this light for 4 cycles waiting to get through, meanwhile there was no line whatsoever on Dee Gabriel Collins, every time their light changed the 2 people waiting went through then we sat and watched no one go through for another 3-4 seconds of red light before getting a measly 12 seconds for a bunch of work trucks to start on a hill and go through. It didn't used to be this bad. Something has changed in the last few weeks. Please look into it.

West bound on W Parmer Ln at the intersection with Metric Blvd. There was recent construction to lengthen the left turn only lane on the south side of Parmer west bound. There is a directional sign on the median that shows that the lane directly to the right of the left turn only lane is a straight only lane (straight arrow). The directional sign attached to the traffic signal shows a double left turn only at the same time that the median sign indicates a left and a straight. The traffic signals are also confusing in that there is a 4 light signal in front of the lane that switches between straight and left directionals that turns red when left turns are not safe/allowed. I think there should only be ONE (1) left turn only lane at all times and the signage and traffic lighting should be updated to reflect that. With the left turn lane being lengthened, I think this is perfectly feasible and would stop all the backed up traffic on Parmer that is caused by confused drivers accidentally ending up in the "left turn only

Caller has called before, ref: 19-00155537- caller states that, when there is traffic on Meadow Lake that wants to turn left to go Westbound on William Cannon, the William Cannon light Eastbound will turn red, but the Meadow Lake light does not turn green at all. Even when her car is in the crosswalk, the light at Meadow Lake still doesn't turn green. She can tell when the Eastbound light turns Red, and so has "experimented" with her car placement, but has resorted to running the light in order to turn left onto William Cannon. Caller describes that once she gets her car far enough into the intersection, fully running the light and going across all lanes, THEN the light will turn green for long enough for about 8 cars to get through.  Caller states that if there is a left turning car on Meadow Lake who doesn't run the light, then the light won't turn green.  I advised of the update as of 5/3, and caller stated that this is still occurring.

So you have to cross without the pedestrian walk signal. And the green light for cars is so fast, you have to run across the street to make it in time. I use this crosswalk a few times a week. Please check it to make sure it is functioning properly. Thank you in advance for your help!

Worse, when the Old Manor side of the light turns green, it is only green for a few seconds before turning red again.

Hello. I was wondering if someone can look at the stop lights at Koenig and Avenue F. In the past, when you approached that light, if it was red, it would change rather quickly. I'm guessing it has a sensor. Recently it stays red (heading east or west) for a long period of time and there's no traffic going north/south. Maybe the sensor needs to be adjusted?

This is new and erroneous operation.

There is a traffic signal for the bike lane on Justin Lane / Pegram Ave and Burnet Rd.  Today I sat at this signal Eastbound from Pegram for three light cycles and it never changed from red.  If the light doesn't work then it's less safe for me to cross the road while parallel traffic has a left turn yield signal, since they generally aren't looking for bikes and it looks like I have a red light as a cyclist.

Subject: Crosswalk light now working correctly

This message is from Roman Guerrero. [ lpoolrg@gmail.com ]
At the intersection of riverside dr and burton/tintin Ford, I was trying to use the crosswalk button at the corner closest to the ER and I would never get the signal to walk after trying to wait about 3 light changes. The cars in opposing traffic would get the green light but would quickly change to let traffic flowing perpendicularly proceed again. Not sure if this has to get looked into.

Then west 12th traffic got a green again.  At that point we gave up & proceeded. If that southbound light won't recognize 5 cyclists, seems doubtful that it will recognize just 1.

Received via Mobile App: Traffic signal not recognizing bikes. I waited through a few cycles of this signal and it never gave me the green to go west bound. Either this doesn't pick up bikes (my frame is steel.) or it's really unclear where bikes should wait in order to get the green. If it's the latter, perhaps a pavement marking would help. I ended up just using the beg button. The timing here is also really slow. I nearly gave up and ran the red.

Traffic lights seem to be irregular and causing a major problem at this intersection. After a long period of time on red they flicker to blinking yellow, then back to solid red. At different times the right turn arrow turns green, all traffic stops but left turn light stays at red. Because this light is staying red it has caused cars to turn left on red since all traffic is stopped. This is happening daily and is extremely dangerous. Cars will continue to turn left on red light since this continues to be an issue.

Request 1: there are tree branches growing low and over the "right turn arrow" stop light facing 2222.  They need to be cut back.
Request 2: the light has a RED right turn arrow and most people run that light.  Law states "no right turn on a red arrow" yet hundreds do it daily.  There should be a sign put up indicating NO RIGHT TURN ON RED or change the arrow to a solid "red" so drivers can turn right if the road is clear to safely do so.  The police/city could make a fortune in giving out tickets to all the drivers that have been running that light and breaking the law.  I hope this signal light can be rectified by either putting up the suggested sign or changing the light to just be red.  Thanks so much!

The traffic signal at Gracy Farms Lane and Metric Boulevard is a struggle. I often cross Metric using Gracy Farms and have a significant wait for the light to change. I understand that most traffic is flowing on Metric but sometimes it takes several minutes of waiting before the light changes. I do not know if there is a sensor of any kind or if the light is just on a timer. If there is a sensor it would seem that it needs adjusting. Additionally, once the light turns green, at some points of the day the light stays green for literally only one car, requiring any cars behind who have been waiting for likely several minutes to choose between waiting for another light cycle or to rush through a yellow/red light. Please consider checking the timing on this traffic signal. Thank you.

Please shorten time to drive through or turn on to Cross Park Drive.  As traffic builds, signal to turn onto Cross Park Drive will be needed.   Light timing off of Exchange Drive is very short.

When traveling east on Howard, there's a stop-light that indicates when you can take a left turn on to the north-bound MoPac frontage road. If you are sitting in the turn lane waiting to turn it's impossible to see the green turn signal. The stoplight has a very narrow field of view and is focused too high. You can see the signal when you are several hundred feet away, but it appears black as you get closer

Please optimize the traffic light for westbound traffic on Martin Luther King Blvd at Airport Blvd to account for the morning rush hour. I take this route regularly to go to work, and end up waiting 4-5 traffic cycles to get through the light due to the poorly timed traffic light. The other directions have minimal traffic, even north and southbound Airport Blvd. I am sitting at the light waiting for it to turn green, and Airport Blvd has a small amount of cars waiting in each direction while westbound MLK has a line of cars backed up to Pershing. One westbound cycle was even inexplicably skipped one time. If the light was optimized to allow more cars to pass going westbound between just 7-9am Monday thru Friday, it would help traffic immensely. Feel free to send a study to the intersection any weekday morning and see what I mean.

Thank you for your time.

On the southeast side of the Rio Grande and 24th Street intersection, the crosswalk signal does not show a count down and does not show a white person when it is okay to walk (the screen just goes blank). The red hand when you can't walk is still there.
Assuming this intersection is within you jurisdiction, I wanted to comment briefly on the light's functionality. It seems to turn red for SW Pkwy traffic at random, even when there are no cars in Terravista. Even if opening properly, it remains red for SW Pkwy traffic battle longer than necessary, backing up traffic. It needs significant adjustment in order to avoid the artificial creation of congestion, brake wear, and air pollution.

Between 6:45-6:59AM, the light turns red for north and south bound West Gate Blvd so that traffic on Stassney Ln/Cherry Creek Dr may proceed through the intersection. I have observed over the last several months, anywhere between 6:35-7:00AM, I have noted that there are zero cars passing through the intersection on Stassney Ln/Cherry Creek Dr while at least 10 cars attempting to drive along West Gate Blvd are stopped. Would there be any way to shorten the Stassney Ln/Cherry Creek Dr light at this time to allow the traffic traveling north and south bout on West Gate Blvd to flow more smoothly?

Something changed with this intersection recently resulting in large backups of morning traffic heading westbound on Southwest Pkwy at Foster Ranch Rd.  My guess is that the left-turn-lane sensor for eastbound Southwest Pkwy onto northbound Foster Ranch Rd is malfunctioning.  It appears that the eastbound-to-northbound left turn lane gets a very, very long left turn green arrow, resulting in a much shorter green cycle for straight-through traffic on westbound Southwest Pkwy.
Repair CCTV
at night the anderson mill traffic should have a green light and it should only turn red if a car is on spicewood pkwy and waiting to make a left onto anderson mill rd.

The Concordia University light is set as if daytime classes are in session. Probably a full 2.5 long  including an extended left turn arrow into Concordia for traffic headed southbound.    Unfortunately  since there are maybe 10 cars on the road at this hour  these red lights or extended arrows are unnecessary and actually hindering the traffic flow.    Everything is set to impede traffic
west side of the street was fixed but not east side 183571, previous SR entered.

Signal to turn left on Silvermine does not detect vehicles. Just sat through 3 cycles of the light before going straight through intersection to do a u-turn and take a right on Silvermine. 

Please make this an unprotected left all the time. There is a mile of clear line of sight and long durations of no oncoming traffic. The light at Covered Bridge allows this and it has poor line of sight from both directions. 

The offset at Silvermine with Fletcher does not impact the passive lefts on 71. Having to sit at light increases vehicle emissions for no reason.

Caller states that recent maintenance of the traffic signal under the bridge on 183 at ohlen rd to head northbound on research blvd has made it dangerous, he states vehicles are able to see the green arrow while at the southbound light a research blvd and ohlen rd, and persons are mistakenly going on red because the see the red arrow at the other intersection
the caller states that the lights run on a schedule to change but during no peak times this causes people to wait at lights where it is green for a road with no cars. the caller would love for motion sensors to be installed but would settle for the schedule to change for non peak time so that this does not happen.

After 6 PM, there are VERY few drivers coming out of the businesses (going east-west on Waterford Center Blvd/Helen Milton Smith Way), yet the green light for these east-west drivers is extremely long. The drivers going north-south on Burnet Road have to wait an unnecessarily long time at the red light while no one has a green light. Additionally, the sequencing of lights for drivers turning left from Research Blvd onto Burnet Rd and going all the way down to Braker Ln could be better. Drivers are always held up at either Waterford Center Blvd/Helen Milton Smith Way or at Rutland Drive. Please improve the traffic flow. Thank you.

This request is in reference to service request number 18-00361144. The traffic signal issue at the intersection of Grove and E. Riverside Dr. has not been  addressed! The request was apparently looked at and closed very quickly on Oct 23. It has been over 2 weeks and the issue is still there! The issue is the protected left turn green arrow on GROVE is not working. This issue occurs after 7p.m. I have been driving this route for over 5 years and this is the 1st I have ever seen for the arrow not to function. The hazzard created by not having the protected left turn green arrow will cause drivers view of on-coming traffic from ACC along Grove to be imparied and lead to vehicle collisions if not so already!  Either send technician or engineer out to observe and assess the protected left turn green arrow. Since this is the 2nd time I am creating a request, you have 10 days to correct the situation or my next step will be to the news media.  please let me know if you need furnter info.

stalled light and flash signal, at 4500 E 51st ST causes huge back up and delays EVERY morning at the parallel intersection of 5100 Springdale, ATX 78723. This light is constantly stalled and stays on green causing major traffic back ups and delays at Springdale, with the Springdale light only staying green for seconds before turning red and switching back over to 51st. There is way more traffic coming and going on Springdale at the intersection than on 51st, and traffic signal should be set to allow more time on green at the Springdale light.
I turned in a service request for this intersection 2 yrs ago in Dec 2016.  This is the light at Davis and 8800 Beckett.  The vehicle detection for Beckett approaches was not working at that time.  It is no longer working now.  Many cars are stopped on Davis for no traffic on Beckett.  Please look into this as it is wasting gas for cars to have to stop for no reason.

 If a person were to walk north on Beckett Street toward Dick Nichols Park and cross Davis Street on Beckett  that person would notice that the pedestrian signal at Beckett and Davis  north east corner  is not working. A couple of months ago I reported the same signal  and it was repaired  but it is again broken. There is a fair amount of pedestrian traffic at that light  and some danger from cars turning right from Beckett to head east on Davis. Without a pedestrian light it is somewhat of a challenge to cross that street when there is traffic.

Both callers previous SR are listed ass resolved but the notes say the buttons and LEDS are fine but the caller is saying it takes two to three cycles for the crossing to maybe work if at all. There is definitely an issue with either timing. OR caller thinks it could be a shorting  only allowing it to work partially.  Caller would like to be contacted by the department to explain further because the intersection is complicated already.

I ve recently been experiencing issues with the intersection lights as I am travelling north on Wickersham. The light seems to cycle through three times before it allows the north south lights to turn green. I waited a full 8 minutes at a red light before the light turned. This has happened more often than not at that light  especially with the construction happening on the southeast corner lot  it s making my morning commute difficult.

This is a follow up to 18-00319837, opened last week for the same problem.  The signal is still not functioning.  It does not detect bicycles waiting at the intersection.  I don't understand why service requests for such problems are closed with no action and no explanation.  It's very frustrating.  If the signal is truly "functioning per plan" even though it doesn't change for bicycles, please reference the plan to which you are referring, so I can work on getting the plan changed.

This needs to be sent over to traffic signals
Traffic light crooked at McNeil & Parmer . Going north on McNeil approaching Parmer.
This request is to specifically look at the pleasant valley southbound left turn movement onto eastbound oltorf on weekday nights (after 10pm). This signal is consistently running short. Namely because that left turn rarely gets a protected movement (I know it runs a protected movement during the daytime, but at night it seems to never). It appears to only run as permissive, even when there is no one on the opposing through movement. This left turn is ALWAYS backed up, much more than the opposing left turn (northbound pleasant valley to westbound oltorf), yet that opposing left turn gets a protected movement???  Thank you for your time.
LEFT TURN SIGNAL ON KRAMER, TURNS GREEN TWICE, SKIPPING GREEN FOR GOING STRAIGHT AHEAD. CARS THAT NEED TO GO STRAIGHT ON THIS ROAD, ARE CAUSING PEOPLE WHO NEED TO TURN TO WAIT UNTIL THE LIGHT ALLOWS THEM TO MOVE FORWARD. TRAFFIC IS INCREASING ON KRAMER BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.

This request is to resolve an annoyance. The ped movement that crosses oltorf has a recall on it, but I am very certain that there is a push button existing on both sides of the street; why is the ped recall necessary? This ped movement runs concurrent with the westbound oltorf left turn onto burleson. With the ped recall removed, y'all could run said left turn with the westbound oltorf through movement. With the lack of pedestrians actually crossing the street, and with the existence of push buttons on both sides of oltorf, I just don't understand the rationale for having that ped on recall. Thank you for your time.

I've noticed that the light for those at Country Trails Lane coming from the schools (SE direction) onto Quinlan may turn green (just circle green, no green left arrow) while the light for those on the opposite side (Country Trails Lane coming from Rio Mesa Dr, NW direction) is red. This is confusing when there are drivers coming from the schools that want to turn left on Quinlan, because since there's no green arrow they're supposed to yield to drivers on the other side. However the light is red for opposite traffic, so they're yielding as well. Seems that either the light's schedule is wrong or the green left arrow is defective.
Thanks, Victor

The timing of this traffic light needs to be adjusted badly. Both the main lanes and side roads are given the same green light time, about 45 seconds, even though the amount of traffic is not equal. Owen Tech usually has only 7 or 8 cars in queue, but is given the same 45 secs as Wells Branch, the main artery with over 20 times the number of cars. This is causing traffic on Wells Branch to back up all the way to the previous intersection and beyond. Please adjust the signal to give more green time to Wells Branch and less time to Owen Tech.

Since a week or two ago, the traffic light at the Duval/Amherst intersection shines green for Amherst way too often, for way too long. Duval is the more major of the two roads, and should thus be given preference. It used to be that, between about midnight and 6am, the light would only turn green for Amherst when a driver on Amherst approached the light. I think it is ridiculous that I, traveling on Duval -- which I do four or five times per day -- should be forced to sit at a red light for up to three minutes for nonexistent drivers on Amherst at midnight. Please fix this right away.

Submitter entered incorrect SR# 23-00559446 via mobile app to AE. Corrected SR# 23-00559553 has been entered to ATD. Notes from submitter: It is located adjacent to the park and is a pedestrian stop light that will only stop traffic if pressed by a pedestrian. Very dangerous right now as a pedestrian may get the signal to walk but the light may not come on resulting in oncoming traffic & possible collisions. Please address soon as someone might get hurt if the remaining light goes out :(

I live at 53 and Duval, last night at 7:30 I believe I saw a glitch with the train and the protective arms that come down when a train is coming, so cars know to stop.

shoal creek blvd @ anderson lane dangerous for bicyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. Traffic lights were altered a while ago and now timings are dangerous.

SB on shoal creek,  a green on left turns, sign says left turn yield on green. NB on shoal creek has a green to go and the Crosswalk gives a walk signal but turns off when halfway across the street and Left turn from SB goes through crosswalk and is a danger to bicyclists and pedestrians. Pedestrians cannot safely cross the street before the left turning vehicles get a green. Needs to be a protected left turn, or flashing yellow arrow.
Modify SB heads on SBFR with retroreflective backplates.

I am an IBM employee who works at the campus at 11501 Burnet Road. The updated street lights to turn southbound on Burnet Road (see attached map) never change to a left turn - protected or unprotected-around or after 6:00pm.

School zone flashing traffic lights not working on Meridian Park Blvd. Baldwin elementary school
Lost comm but still sending traffic to other intersections.
lost COMM Saturday check comm
There is a light at the intersection of Maverick Way (McNeil High School entrance road) and McNeil Dr, which also involves the exit drive from the Northwest Family YMCA. The light controlling the exit from the YMCA stays green for only 6 seconds (I timed it this morning), allowing only 2 cars to exit at a time, causing a massive traffic backup in the YMCA parking lot. It took me 3 changes of the light to exit today and I was in the middle of the line of cars wanting to exit. This is exacerbated by some McNeil High School traffic turning into the YMCA parking lot, flipping a u-turn, and exiting straight to go to the high school in an attempt to avoid the exceptionally long line of cars waiting on McNeil Drive to turn left into the school, even though taking this route probably ends up taking longer. The green light controlling exit from the YMCA needs to be extended significantly, to allow all cars waiting to exit the YMCA parking lot during a single light change. Maybe 30 seconds?

My son rides his bike across Slaughter at Menchaca to go from Curlew Dr to the Planet Fitness.  He says most days, the crosswalk light never comes on. He has waited through several cycles, so he just goes with the green light instead of waiting for the actual crosswalk light.  That seems dangerous, so I would like you to review the crosswalk light timing when hitting the crosswalk button.

caller states the traffic signal is skipping the left turn signal heading west on 5th street causing traffic to back up.
WB Riverside Left-Turn Arrow lights do not come on, causing a traffic hazard since only one car can get through at a time.
The timing sequence of the traffic light at slaughter and the entrance to Bowie High School is incorrect.  It is now cycling thru every possible light /turn signal combination regardless if a vehicle hits the sensors.  This is causing backups all along Slaughter in both directions.  This is not the normal timing for school drop off/pickup either.  It's occurring all day long.

Recently closed request 24-00142036.  Let me try again.  The crosswalk sign is crooked and can?t see to cross from the cross walk.  If your technician will stand at the crosswalk crossing closest to La Costa Condominium sign at intersection, he will see that the crosswalk sign is crooked.  If he will enlarge pictures, he will see what?s wrong with the sign.  There is one intersection that allows us to ingress/egress from La Costa Condominium into HEB gas station and Star Bucks parking lot.

Light at Parkfield and Peyton Gin. Please change the signals back to ?normal? green, red and yellow. The flashing yellow light for southbound drivers on Parkfield seems to be absolutely confusing drivers and people end up missing the whole light cycle because people don?t understand you can go on a yellow flashing light. For some reason, there are times where this light never cycles through to green and you end up stuck.

Please see SR 24-00129682 

Citizens email: I called in "Service Request Number: 24-00129682. Service Request Type: ATD - Traffic Signal - Maintenance" and was told the the city "checked traffic signal functions through historical timing values, live graphics and CCTV. This signal appears to be working per plan." but I'm not yet convinced. :-)

I've uploaded my dashcam footage from that morning to Youtube to see if that helps explain the issue. What I see is that at:

7:52:49 AM (and previous) both SW Parkway and turn onto William Cannon are red

7:53:31 AM SW Parkway light turns green

7:54:15 AM Car that's been waiting since before my arrival to turn onto William Cannon gives up and re-enters SW Parkway

7:54:56 AM SW Parkway begins cycle to red

7:55:42 AM SW Parkway again cycles to green (note that the William Cannon turn signal has not yet cycled to green)

7:56:51 AM SW Parkway again cycles to red

7:57:46 AM Parkway again cycles to green (another cycle but still no green for the William Cannon turn signal)

7:58:31 AM Having witnessed SW Parkway cycle to green THREE times without the turn onto William Cannon cycling even once, I too give up on the turn signal and continue.

Now perhaps this is indeed "working per plan" (y'all do try out some cool traffic signal patterns), but for anyone waiting to turn east onto William Cannon what we see is the "forward" light for southbound Southwest Parkway cycling to green three times without there ever being a green light at the William Cannon turn lane. With cars ahead and behind of me aborting, and with cars honking (presumably because I'm not "running the red/broken turn signal"), is this indeed "working per plan"?

crosswalk lights do not wok when the button is pushed
N and S it's flashing red. E yellow is strobe lighting and red flashing
To specify, there is a traffic light at the Samsung Plant and E Parmer Lane intersection that this issue happens at. There is a protected left turn modification for the two lanes that turn left on to the Samsung Property, HOWEVER, the light can take up to 10 minutes to turn green to allow for drivers to turn. Drivers often will turn left on red to avoid being late for work and this can cause accidents. This is a daily issue at that light that needs to be adjusted IMMEDIATELY! I personally have been late to work several times now because of the amount of time that light takes to turn green.

DSDD - Not Working
received via email:  Recently, at the intersection of Parmer Lane and Tamayo Drive, the left turn arrow timing was changed for the Westbound side of Parmer Lane. Whereas previously, it would remain green long enough for 4-6 cars to turn left, it now only lasts approximately 2 seconds. Two cars can barely get through the intersection with the second car facing a yellow light during its turn. During peak traffic hours, that left turn lane can easily have 5-6 cars in it, and with only 2 cars passing through, the turn lane itself ends up having cars protruding into Parmer Lane--where the flow of traffic around this intersection easily being 50+ mph. This is now a hazard. The two possible solutions are to 1) return the timing to its original length, or 2) change the left turn arrow to a blinking yellow/yield light. The second option is preferable because, along that corridor of Parmer Lane, the viewing distance for oncoming traffic is very long, and, there are many times when left turn patrons must wait with no oncoming traffic. Please seriously consider changing the light timing, because in its present state, it's potentially hazardous.

Caller wanted to remain anonymous.

Hello, please review the flash schedule as it's changed this week.  In early mornings/late evenings the traffic light at this intersection is 'cycling'.

lights are flashing red in all directions
I also shared with Oak Hill Parkway team but the light at HEB on FM1826 has a new simultaneous multi-direction flashing yellow arrow which makes it easier to exit the HEB parking lot onto FM1826 but unnecessarily backs traffic up dangerously close or onto HWY290 especially during rush hour.  This poses a risk for high speed rear end collisions on HWY290.  Please remove this new multi-direction flashing yellow arrow segment and revert to the previous signal sequencing or come up with another mitigation plan to avoid backing traffic up onto HWY290.  Thanks for your consideration!
